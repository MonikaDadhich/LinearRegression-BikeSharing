# Bike_Sharing
> Here we will build multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. 


Essentially, the company wants to know â€”

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information

### Business Problem

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.


### Business Goal

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
- Demand for rental bikes will be increased every passing year
- There will be decrease in demand on Rainy and Cloudy weather and comparatively more demand on Clear weather
- Demand for rental bikes is in good relation of temperature which means when temeprature will increase it will result into more demand
- Windspeed slower will lead to more demand
- Seasons of Summer and Winter will have more demand for rental bikes
- Demand for rental bikes will be higher on weekends

## Result
- F-statistic : 232.9
- Adj. R-squared : 0.834
- Durbin-Watson value : 2.005
- Mean_Squared_Error : 0.0089
